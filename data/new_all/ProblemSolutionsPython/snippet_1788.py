# Python implementation of converting
# a string into a dictionary
  
# initialising string 
str = " Jan = January; Feb = February; Mar = March"
  
# At first the string will be splitted
# at the occurence of ';' to divide items 
# for the dictionaryand then again splitting 
# will be done at occurence of '=' which
# generates key:value pair for each item
dictionary = dict(subString.split("=") for subString in str.split(";"))
  
# printing the generated dictionary
print(dictionary)
